# SpinGlass
We introduce a Qiskit implementation designed to determine the ground state of a spin glass model with a randomly generated interaction graph. This implementation employs the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to address the combinatorial optimization problem represented by the spin glass Hamiltonian.
